## Quick Description

I looked at Typescript before, it's been on a list of technologies to learn more about. With that being said, I don't know it well enough right now, and it wouldn't be beneficial to attempt to use it for this project. So, this challenge has been done with JavaScript. It uses one package, axios.

## Setting up

After cloning, run `npm install`. Then run `node index.js`, entering the desired postal code or city. **Note**: You can also run the shell script provided to automate the above. Run `make weather`, then to execute `./weather`.
